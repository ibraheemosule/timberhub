## Product List App

This is a list of dummy products that can be used for testing purposes. Each product has a unique identifier and a corresponding product page that displays information about the product. The list of products can be filtered by a search field and a product's dimensions can be filtered with a given range.

The dropdown list options are not wood terms, rather they are values gotten from a [Lorem Ipsum Text Here](https:https://loremipsum.io/)

## All Products Page

## Add Product

A product can be added to the database by clicking on add product and filling the form. When the form validation passes, the product can be add.

When a product in the product list is clicked on, users are directed to a product details page.

A dimension card can be deleted from the dimensions section. But this action is impossible if there is only one dimension card present
